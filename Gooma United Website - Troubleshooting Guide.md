# Gooma United Website - Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides steps to diagnose and resolve the "Response was blocked by CORB" and "Blocked form submission" errors you are encountering.

## Understanding the Errors

*   **CORB (Cross-Origin Read Blocking):** This is a browser security feature that prevents a web page from reading certain cross-origin network responses. Even if the server (Firebase) allows the request via CORS, the browser might block it if it deems the response type or context to be sensitive or potentially malicious.
*   **"Blocked form submission to '' because the form's frame is sandboxed and the 'allow-forms' permission is not set."**: This error typically occurs when a form is submitted from within an `iframe` that lacks the `allow-forms` sandbox attribute. However, in a direct website deployment, this is highly unusual and suggests a deeper browser security mechanism or a misinterpretation of the environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps

Since the code and Firebase rules appear correct, these issues are likely related to your browser environment or a subtle interaction with the Firebase setup.

### Step 1: Re-verify Firebase Configuration and Rules

Even though you've confirmed these, a quick re-check can sometimes catch overlooked details.

1.  **Firebase Project ID and API Key:**
    *   Ensure the `firebaseConfig` in `src/lib/firebase.js` exactly matches the credentials provided in the initial prompt. Pay close attention to `projectId`, `apiKey`, and `authDomain`.
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyCh0OjEQ2q1Pfypc-tOPPaJg0bHNzQaaPc",
      authDomain: "sagachat-3cfaf.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "sagachat-3cfaf",
      storageBucket: "sagachat-3cfaf.firebasestorage.app",
      messagingSenderId: "1035940942432",
      appId: "1:1035940942432:web:7cf07b666dc7e3fd74a905",
      measurementId: "G-EXYPTFEJFX"
    };
    ```

2.  **Firestore Security Rules:**
    *   Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) -> Your Project (`sagachat-3cfaf`) -> **Firestore Database** -> **Rules**.
    *   Confirm the rules are *exactly* as follows and have been **Published**:
    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        // Allow read access to all documents for authenticated users
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read: if request.auth != null;
        }
        
        // Allow write access to matches collection for authenticated users
        match /matches/{matchId} {
          allow write: if request.auth != null;
        }
        
        // Allow write access to players collection for authenticated users
        match /players/{playerId} {
          allow write: if request.auth != null;
        }
        
        // Allow write access to news collection for authenticated users
        match /news/{newsId} {
          allow write: if request.auth != null;
        }
        
        // Allow write access to venues collection for authenticated users
        match /venues/{venueId} {
          allow write: if request.auth != null;
        }
        
        // Allow users to read and write their own player profile
        match /players/{playerId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == resource.data.email;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3.  **Authentication Method:**
    *   Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) -> Your Project (`sagachat-3cfaf`) -> **Authentication** -> **Sign-in method**.
    *   Ensure **Email/Password** is **Enabled**.

4.  **Admin User Existence:**
    *   Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) -> Your Project (`sagachat-3cfaf`) -> **Authentication** -> **Users**.
    *   Confirm that `tibo@indii.be` exists and has a password set.

### Step 2: Browser-Specific Troubleshooting

These steps help rule out local browser issues.

1.  **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:**
    *   This is crucial. Old cached data can interfere. Perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) after clearing.

2.  **Try Incognito/Private Browsing Mode:**
    *   Open the website in an incognito or private browsing window. This disables extensions and uses a clean cache, which can help identify if an extension is causing the issue.

3.  **Try a Different Browser:**
    *   Test the website in a completely different browser (e.g., if you're using Chrome, try Firefox or Edge). This helps determine if the issue is browser-specific.

4.  **Check Browser Console for Warnings/Errors:**
    *   Open Developer Tools (F12) -> **Console** tab.
    *   Look for any red error messages or yellow warnings that appear when you load the page or attempt to log in. These can provide more context.

### Step 3: Network Tab Deep Dive (If errors persist)

If the errors continue, we need to examine the network activity in detail.

1.  **Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Network tab.**
2.  **Reproduce the issue:** Refresh the page and attempt to log in as admin.
3.  **Filter for `XHR` or `Fetch` requests:** These are typically the requests made by Firebase.
4.  **Identify the blocked request:** Look for any requests that are highlighted in red or show a `(blocked:other)` or `(failed)` status.
5.  **Examine the request details:**
    *   Click on the blocked request.
    *   Go to the **Headers** tab: Check `Request Headers` and `Response Headers` for anything unusual.
    *   Go to the **Response** tab: See if there's any content, even if it's an error message.
    *   Go to the **Timing** tab: Look for any unusual delays or failures.
6.  **Provide a screenshot of the Network tab** with the blocked request selected and its details visible.

### Step 4: Verify `AuthContext` Persistence

I have already implemented this, but it's good to confirm the change is active.

*   Ensure `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` includes:
    ```javascript
    import {
      // ... other imports
      setPersistence,
      browserLocalPersistence
    } from 'firebase/auth';
    
    // ...
    
    const signin = async (email, password) => {
      await setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence);
      return await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    };
    ```

## Possible Underlying Causes (Less Likely but Worth Considering)

*   **Ad-blockers or Security Software:** Temporarily disable any ad-blockers, VPNs, or security software that might be interfering with network requests.
*   **Browser Security Settings:** Very strict browser security settings might be causing the issue. You could try resetting browser settings to default (as a last resort).
*   **Firebase SDK Version:** While unlikely, an incompatibility with a specific Firebase SDK version could theoretically cause this. However, the current setup uses standard practices.

## Next Steps

Please go through these troubleshooting steps systematically. The more information you can gather, especially from the browser's Network tab, the better I can assist in pinpointing the exact cause of the problem.
